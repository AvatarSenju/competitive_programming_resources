Consider an undirected graph where each edge is the same weight. Each of the nodes is labeled consecutively.

You will be given a number of queries. For each query, you will be given a list of edges describing an undirected graph. After you create a representation of the graph, 
you must determine and report the shortest distance to each of the other nodes from a given starting position using the breadth-first search algorithm (BFS). 
Distances are to be reported in node number order, ascending. If a node is unreachable, print -1 for that node. Each of the edges weighs 6 units of distance.

For example, given a graph with 5 nodes and 3 edges [1,2],[1,3],[3,4].

The start node for the example is node 1. Outputs are calculated for distances to nodes 2 through 5:[6,6,12,-1] . Each edge is 6 units, and the unreachable node 5 
has the required return distance of -1.
